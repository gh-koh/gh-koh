## Projects

More details on each project can be found in the README files of the respective repos.

### [Perception of AI in South Korea vs Vietnam](https://github.com/gh-koh/Hongik-Project)

This is an ongoing project for [GCT Lab](https://gctlab-hongik.ac.kr/), a lab affiliated with the [School of Games](https://www.husg.net/) at [Hongik University](https://www.hongik.ac.kr) in South Korea. The project analyzes differences in the perception of AI by students and professionals in the game and graphic industries between South Korea and Vietnam by collecting survey answers from over 400 participants in both countries.

### [Analysis and Visualization of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway](https://github.com/gh-koh/Seoul-Subway)

This is a personal project where I put together traffic data on the [Seoul Metropolitan Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Metropolitan_Subway) from the [Seoul Open Data Plaza](https://data.seoul.go.kr/), along with HMTL data scraped from a [map](http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/kr/cyberStation.do) of the subway system, to produce an analysis and visualization of hourly traffic of the subway system by month from 2015 to the present.
